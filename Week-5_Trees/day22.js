// Drill 2 of 5: Same Tree
// Given the roots of two binary trees,
// determine whether the trees are structurally identical and have the same node values.

// Return true if they are the same, otherwise return false.

// One hint

// At each pair of nodes, there are three important cases:
// Both are null → they're equal.
// Exactly one is null → they're different.
// Both exist → their values must match, and their left and right subtrees must match.

// That's it. No need to overcomplicate this one.
